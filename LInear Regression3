Data03 = read.csv("data 4.20.csv")

From the above fitted model it is clear that only __p value__ of the __Acid.Temp__ variable is below $0.05$ and rest of the explanatory variable have their p value greater than $0.05$.

This implies that __only__ the __Acid.Temp__ variable is __significant__ and rest are insignificant.

Adding to it the adjusted $R^2$ for the model is $0.3527$. Therefore, the explanatory variables explain $35.27\%$ of the variation in y.

But, since the __p value__ of the model is less than $0.05$ thereby, the __model is significant__.

```



### Variable :  Acid.Temp

We have the model as:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Acid.Temp + \epsilon$$

Fitting the model using _lm function_:


```{r}
ml03_2 = lm(y ~ Acid.Temp, data = Data03)
summary(ml03_2)
```

From the above table it is clear that the __Acid.Temp__ is __significant__ for the model since it's __p value__ is less than $0.05$.

The __p value__ for the model is also less than $0.05$ which means that the model is significant.

The value of $R^2$ is $0.2979$ which means that $29.79\%$ of variability in y is explained by Acid.Temp.

Since, there are no insignificant variables therefore we proceed to our next model.


### Variable :  Acid.Temp and Acid.Conc

We have the model as:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Acid.Temp + \beta_2 \times Acid.Conc + \epsilon$$

Fitting the model using _lm function_:


```{r}
ml03_3 = lm(y ~ Acid.Temp + Acid.Conc, data = Data03)
summary(ml03_3)
```

From the above table it is clear that the __Acid.Temp__ and __Acid.Conc__ is __significant__ for the model since it's __p value__ is less than or very close to $0.05$.

The __p value__ for the model is also less than $0.05$ which means that the model is significant.

The value of adjusted $R^2$ is $0.3717$ which means that $37.17\%$ of variability in y is explained by the explanatory variables.

Since, there are no insignificant variables therefore we proceed to our next model.


### Variable :  Acid.Temp, Acid.Conc and Sulfide.Conc

We have the model as:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Acid.Temp + \beta_2 \times Acid.Conc + \beta_3 \times Sulfide.Conc  + \epsilon$$

Fitting the model using _lm function_:


```{r}
ml03_4 = lm(y ~ Acid.Temp + Acid.Conc + Sulfide.Conc, data = Data03)
summary(ml03_4)
```


From the above table it is clear that the __Acid.Temp__ and __Acid.Conc__ is __significant__ for the model since it's __p value__ is less than or very close to $0.05$.

But, the __p value__ of __Sulfide.Conc__ is greater than $0.05$. Therefore, it is __insignificant__. 

The __p value__ for the model is also less than $0.05$ which means that the model is significant.

The value of adjusted $R^2$ is $0.3717$ which means that $37.17\%$ of variability in y is explained by the explanatory variables.

Since, we got an insignificant variable thereby we stop over here.


The fit for the model by forward selection method is given by:


$$y = 45.4263 + 0.7454  \times Acid.Temp + 20.2292 \times Acid.Conc + \epsilon$$

## Backward selection model fitting

### Variable :  Acid.Temp, Acid.Conc, Sulfide.Conc, Bleach.Amount and Water.temp

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Acid.Temp + \beta_2 \times Acid.Conc + \beta_3 \times Sulfide.Conc + \beta_4 \times Water.Temp + \beta_5 \times Bleach.Amount + \epsilon$$

Fitting the model using _lm function_:


```{r}
ml03_5 = lm(y ~ ., data = Data03)
summary(ml03_5)
```

From the above table clear that only __Acid.Temp__ is __significant__ as it's __p value__ is less than $0.05$.

The value of __Adjusted $R^2$__ is $0.3527$. It means that these explanatory explains $35.27\%$ of variability of y.

The __p value__ of the model is less than $0.05$. It means that the above model is __significant__.

Since, the most __insignificant__ explanatory variable is __Sulfide.Conc__ therby we __drop__ this variable on the next model.


### Variable :  Acid.Temp, Acid.Conc, Bleach.Amount and Water.temp

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Acid.Temp + \beta_2 \times Acid.Conc + \beta_3 \times Water.Temp + \beta_4 \times Bleach.Amount + \epsilon$$

Fitting the model using _lm function_:

```{r}
ml03_6 = lm(y ~ . - Sulfide.Conc, data = Data03)
summary(ml03_6)
```

From the above table clear that only __Acid.Temp__ is __significant__ as it's __p value__ is less than $0.05$.

The value of __Adjusted $R^2$__ is $0.3721$. It means that these explanatory explains $37.21\%$ of variability of y.

The __p value__ of the model is less than $0.05$. It means that the above model is __significant__.

Since, the most __insignificant__ explanatory variable is __Bleach.Amount__ therby we __drop__ this variable on the next model.

### Variable :  Acid.Temp, Acid.Conc and Water.temp

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Acid.Temp + \beta_2 \times Acid.Conc + \beta_3 \times Water.Temp + \epsilon$$

Fitting the model using _lm function_:

```{r}
ml03_7 = lm(y ~ . - Sulfide.Conc - Bleach.Amount, data = Data03)
summary(ml03_7)
```

From the above table clear that only __Acid.Temp__ and __Acid.Conc__ are__significant__ as it's __p value__ is less than or very close to $0.05$.

The value of __Adjusted $R^2$__ is $0.3809$. It means that these explanatory explains $38.09\%$ of variability of y.

The __p value__ of the model is less than $0.05$. It means that the above model is __significant__.

Since, the most __insignificant__ explanatory variable is __Water.Temp__ thereby we __drop__ this variable on the next model.

### Variable :  Acid.Temp and Acid.Conc

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Acid.Temp + \beta_2 \times Acid.Conc + \epsilon$$

Fitting the model using _lm function_:

```{r}
ml03_8 = lm(y ~ . - Sulfide.Conc - Bleach.Amount - Water.Temp, data = Data03)
summary(ml03_8)
```



From the above table clear that __Acid.Temp__ and __Acid.Conc__ are __significant__ as there __p value__ is less than or very close to $0.05$.

The value of __Adjusted $R^2$__ is $0.3717$. It means that these explanatory explains $37.17\%$ of variability of y.

The __p value__ of the model is less than $0.05$. It means that the above model is __significant__.

Since, the model does not contain any insignificant variable thereby, this model is the most significant and best fit.


# Best fit for the given model


Now, we notice that the best fit model in forward and backward selection method comes out to be same.

Therefore, our best fit model for the given data is given as: 

$y=  45.4263 + 0.7454 \times Acid.Temp + 20.2292 \times Acid.Conc + \epsilon$


The value of __Adjusted $R^2$__ in case of the best fit for the model is $0.3717$. It means that these explanatory explains $37.17\%$ of variability of y.

The __p value__ of the model is less than $0.05$. It means that the above model is __significant__.
